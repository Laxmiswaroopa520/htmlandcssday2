Header part:



1.display-flex: align elements in a horizontal way.
2.justify-content: space-between; Pushes child elements (logo and navigation) to opposite sides (left & right).
3.list-style:none;  /* remove bulletin points because we have used ul */
4.box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
0 â†’ offset-x = 0 â†’ shadow is centered horizontally (no left/right shift).

2px â†’ offset-y = 2px â†’ shadow moves 2px downward (below the element).

5px â†’ blur-radius = 5px â†’ edges are blurred by 5px â†’ soft look.

rgba(0,0,0,0.1) â†’ shadow color = black (0,0,0) with 10% opacity.

rgba = red, green, blue, alpha (alpha = transparency).

0.1 means very light, subtle shadow.


5.position: sticky; â†’ Makes the header stick to the top of the page when scrolling.

6.top: 0; â†’ Ensures it sticks at the very top.

7.z-index: 1000; â†’ Keeps the header above other elements (so it doesnâ€™t get hidden when scrolling).



// SECTION part

1.<section> defines a thematic grouping of content.

Used when you want to group content that has a logical meaning or theme.



//grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));

This line controls how many columns appear.

repeat(...) â†’ Tells the browser how many columns to repeat.

auto-fit â†’ Automatically fits as many columns as possible in the available space.

minmax(250px, 1fr) â†’ Each column must be at least 250px wide, but can grow up to fill available space (1fr).

ðŸ‘‰ Effect:

On a big screen: multiple columns (3â€“4 cards in a row).

On a tablet/smaller screen: fewer columns (maybe 2 cards in a row).

On a mobile screen: 1 column (cards stacked vertically).

This makes your layout responsive without writing extra media queries.
